#  Language Processor Construction
This is my source code for COMPSCI 142B Language Processor Construction at UC Irvine. The project was to read Java byte code and either interpret it, or translate it to SSA, optimize it, output it as x86-64 machine code, and execute it in the same process (as a JIT compiler).
